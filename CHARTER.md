## Purpose

Explore:

    - **Developer Experience (DX)**
    - **Sustainable Software Practices**
    - **Developer Autonomy**
    - **AI as a contributing entity**


## Objectives

- Develop tools and documentation that implement and demonstrate **Crisp Principles**, ensuring enhanced **Developer Experience (DX)** and autonomy.
- Define and document **Crisp Principles**, an adaptation of Agile that incorporates Docs-as-Code methodologies, AI assistance, and sustainable software practices.
- Integrate AI into Agile workflows, utilizing AI-assisted documentation, code suggestions, and backlog management.
- Iteratively improve tools and methodologies by applying them to real-world, non-trivial projects (**"dogfooding"**).
- Share principles, tools, and documentation with the public by publishing on GitHub.
- Encourage discussions on principles, their implementation, and their impact on development workflows.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary Developer (me)** – I will actively use and refine this tool for my own projects.
- **Developers, Agile Practitioners, and Docs-as-Code Enthusiasts** – Others interested in leveraging this resource for their workflows.
- **Contributors** – Anyone interested in improving the project through code contributions, documentation enhancements, and discussions on refining tools and principles.
- **AI Agents** – AI-driven tools that assist in Agile facilitation, documentation updates, and intelligent code suggestions.

## Risks

- Introducing unnecessary complexity into projects, governance structures, git logs, or build processes.
- Limited or negligible productivity improvements despite the effort invested.
- Wasting time developing tools and documentation that do not provide tangible benefits.
- Ethical and governance challenges related to AI-assisted contributions and authorship.

## Success Metrics

- Observable improvements in **productivity and focus** when using Crisp methodologies across various projects.
- Ability to **resume work seamlessly** on a project after a period of inactivity, emphasizing sustainable software practices.
- Positive feedback from users and the development community regarding **Developer Experience (DX) and empowerment**.
- **Engagement on GitHub**, including stars, issues, contributions, and discussions.
- **Effective AI-assisted contributions**, including documentation updates, intelligent issue tracking, and Agile facilitation.
- **Sustained personal adoption** of the framework, leading to long-term iterative enhancements.
