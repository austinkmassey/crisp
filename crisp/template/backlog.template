**User Value Statement:**
As a developer, I need a clear understanding of the project's architecture so that I can start building the product with alignment, consistency, and clarity.

**Requirement Description:**
- Define the project's high-level architecture and major components.
- Prepare the code repository with a basic skeleton and packaging infrastructure to streamline future development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Architecture Overview Document:** Includes a diagram and a brief description of each component's role and technology. Stored in `docs/architecture.md`.
- **Initial Git and Code Setup:** Code repository contains a basic Python project structure (e.g., source directories, `setup.py`) to enable immediate iteration.
- All documents reside under version control in the project's repository. `README.md` links to each artifact for easy navigation.

**Supporting Notes/Attachments:**
- NB will be used to record and manage the backlog items.
